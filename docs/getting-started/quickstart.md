# Quickstart

This tutorial will showcases how to use Axon to build a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) that can **multiply two signed numbers**. In particular, it covers how to define the SNN, input values to it, simulate its execution and read out the output.


## Multiplier and encoder

The spiking neural networks (SNN) defined with **Axon SDK** are quite different from what's conventionally understood by spiking neural networks. They have 2 fundamental differences:

- Axon's SNNs don't need to be trained.
- Axon uses a pair of spikes to encode a value.

Axon's SNNs are pre-defined networks of neurons and synapses that implement a certain computation - they are not a trainable SNN.

One of such computations is a multiplication operation, which is available in Axon:

```python
from axon_sdk.networks import MultiplierNetwork

multiplier_net = MultiplierNetwork(encoder)
```

Axon abstracts the complexity of the underlying SNN into a modular interface that allows composing computation kernels to achieve larger operations.

The multiplier network requires an *encoder* to work. The encoder is the component that translates between arithmetic values and spike intervals.

```python
from axon_sdk.primitives import DataEncoder

encoder = DataEncoder(Tmin=10.0, Tcod=100.0)

spikes = enc.encode_value(0.2)
interval = spikes[1] - spikes[0]
value = enc.decode_interval(interval)
```
```text
spikes
>> (0, 30.0)

value
>> 0.2
```

## Simulating the SNN

There is one last fundamental ingredient to execute the SNN - the *simulator*:

```python
from axon_sdk.primitives import Simulator

sim = Simulator(multiplier_net, encoder, dt=0.01)
```

The simulator runs a sequential execution of the dynamics of the SNN, hence the need of a simulation timestep parameter (`dt`).

The simulator also allows to input values to the network. Under the hood, it uses the encoder to do so:

```python
sim.apply_input_value(0.5, neuron=net.input1)
sim.apply_input_value(0.5, neuron=net.input2)
```

The last step is to run the simulation and to readout the spikes emitted by the output neuron

```python
sim.simulate(simulation_time=400)
spikes = sim.spike_log.get(net.output.uid, [])

interval = spikes[1] - spikes[0]
output_val = encoder.decode_interval(interval)
```
```text
output_val
>> 0.2
```



Instead of using spiking rates to encode values which encode values over many spikes, Axon uses inter-spike intervals. The delay betweekn a couple of spikes encodes a value. This makes Axon extremely spike sparse, hence optimizing for energy consumption (when deploying spiking neural networks to hardware, processing each spike has an energy cost)
